## Introduction
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Java, used to store elements of the same type. 
They are essential for various algorithms and problem-solving techniques. 
This repository provides implementations and explanations of common array algorithms.

## Linear Search
#### Explanation
Linear search is a simple algorithm to find an element in an array. 
It sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or the whole array has been searched.

Example
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], target = 6
Output: Element found at index: 2

## Binary Search
#### Explanation
Binary search is an efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Example
Input: arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], target = 6
Output: Element found at index: 2

## Kadane's Algorithm
#### Explanation
Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of integers.

Example
Input: arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output: Maximum subarray sum is: 6

## Subarray Related Problems
#### Explanation
Subarray problems involve finding or manipulating subarrays within an array.
Common problems include finding the maximum sum subarray, checking for subarrays with specific properties, etc.

### Practice Questions

1. Write a program to find the longest increasing subarray in a given array.
2. Implement a function to find the subarray with the given sum in an array of non-negative integers.
3. Write a program to count the number of subarrays with a sum equal to a given value.
